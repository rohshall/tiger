# cat

A compiler of tiger language.


## compile

* `make` in top directory of the project to compile, and the output file is `./build/cat.out`.
* `make clean` will remove `./build/cat.out`.
* `make clean_ly` will remove the files that are generated by flex and bison.

## note

When you add new **.cpp** and **.h** files in `./src`, you don't need to change the `Makefile`.

## difference

The details of cat's semantic checking are different from that of tiger.

1. var/type/function name can't be the same.
2. code can't define function recursively.

## Graphviz

* Before you want to see the output graph you have to install graphviz
* In linux you can use `sudo apt-get install graphviz` to easily install graphviz.
* You can use `dot -Tjpg [filename] -o[outputfilename]` to get the ans jpg.
* Ex. `dot -Tjpg irt.dot -oirt.jpg`
