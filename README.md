# cat

A compile of tiger language.


## compile

* `make` in top directory of the project to compile, and the output file is `./build/cat.out`.
* `make clean` will remove `./build/cat.out` file.
* `make clean_ly` will remove the files that are generated by flex and bison.

## note

When you add new **.cpp** and **.h** files in `./src`, you don't need to change the `Makefile`.
